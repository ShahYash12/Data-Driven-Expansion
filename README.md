# 📊 Financial Performance & Expansion Strategy Analysis – *Enova vs JPMorgan Chase*

## 🧠 Overview

This data analysis project explores and compares the financial performance of **Enova International** and **JPMorgan Chase (JPMC)** to evaluate business health, identify operational strengths, and make **strategic recommendations for expansion**.  

🔍 As part of my role, I **analyzed multi-year financial data**, calculated key performance indicators, and **modeled the expected financial impact of opening new offices** for JPMC. This work guided the final recommendation for selecting a new location based on **IRR, NPV, and cost-benefit analysis**.
